## V3-Mapkit - DestinationsList and Navigation

![mac128](Images/mac128.png)This repository contains the source code for the entire series on iOS 17 MapKit with SwiftData integration.

Each video in the series has its own branch so if you have not started from the beginning, make sure that you clone or download the correct branch for the video.

This is the branch for the completed code for the 3rd video on MapKit where we provide a way to added, edit and delete Destinations and navigate to the destination screen and set the region.
