## V10-Mapkit - MapControls and Styles

![mac128](Images/mac128.png)This repository contains the source code for the entire series on iOS 17 MapKit with SwiftData integration.

Each video in the series has its own branch so if you have not started from the beginning, make sure that you clone or download the correct branch for the video.

This is the branch for the completed code for the 10th video on MapKit.  In this video we complete the application by adding in MapControls and learning about map scope.  We will also create our own map configuration struct so that we can let the user choose what map style they wish such as standard or satellite.  Perhaps they want to see realistic elevation or traffic.
