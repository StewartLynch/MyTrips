## V9-Mapkit - Routes and Directions

![mac128](Images/mac128.png)This repository contains the source code for the entire series on iOS 17 MapKit with SwiftData integration.

Each video in the series has its own branch so if you have not started from the beginning, make sure that you clone or download the correct branch for the video.

This is the branch for the completed code for the 9th video on MapKit.  In this video you will be shown how you can display a route between your current location and one of your selected placemarks.  The route can be either by automobile or by walking.  In addition, you will see how you can provide step by step directions.
